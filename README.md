Kirke is a data transformation tool that allows multiplex transformation on multiple data sources.
In simpler terms:
> It takes data from multiple sources, does things to it, then places it somewhere else.

The transformation takes place during the "does thing to it" phase, which can comprise of many tasks such as:
- Conversion
- Aggregation
- Separation
- Etc.

## Tasks
At the lowest level in Kirke are tasks. A task performs a single operation on an input, which produces an output.

```
Input --> Operation --> Output
```

But it gets even better! A task can also have zero or _multiple_ inputs, each of which can come from different data 
sources, and zero or _multiple_ output, each can also be linked up to different places. 

A zero-input task is called a ***producer***, and an example of such task can be a data source that generates data on 
the fly.

A zero-output task is called a ***consumer***, and is typically used for IO-related tasks such as file writer.

By itself a task is not as useful, if not sometimes unwieldy as it grows overtime and has to perform a lot of
transformation steps. So instead, you can link up multiple tasks together to form a transformation graph that can move
data freely within the graph.

Here a visualisation of a transformation graph that has three tasks:

The flow starts when we read a file and ends when we write to a file. By having multiple tasks instead of one big task
everything, we can start modularise our data flow. For example, if we want to fetch data from an URL we only need to 
create a producer to do the fetching, and then link it up with our Task 2.

There are currently multiple built-in tasks that provide most common functionality, however you can also create your own
task which can give you more freedom over how you want to process your data. Check out [Custom tasks]() for more info.

Each task must be given a unique ID which can be referred to by other tasks. This is simply denoted with `:id` key with
a value of any string.

### Input
A task can receive input from zero or multiple data sources. Some of the most common data sources are databases, files,
servers, or even other tasks. 

Input receives data _only_, which is different from other frameworks that may treat input as both data and data stores.
Kirke only allows raw data to be received by input, whereas [operations](#operation) can be used to process the data
store itself. Operations are also used to data generation as "generation" does not mean the data but rather the act of 
generating itself. The rationale behind this decision is so that we can keep input as "pure" as possible and that input
should ever be concerned about the data itself.

Input can also be attached with [triggers](#trigger) which can perform various things upon receiving input data. One of
which is the well-known and much-needed data validation.

Input is denoted with the `:input` keyword whose value is another map with the following keys:

| Key | Value | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `:source` | String | String | Can either be a URL to a file, a web endpoint, a database or a task ID (prefixed with `id:`) |
| `:triggers` | String or keyword vector | String vector | Indicates what triggers to apply upon receiving input. Can either be built-in trigger or trigger ID (prefixed with `id:`) |

### Operation
Operation lays out what transformation to perform to the received input. Each task type varies depending on what type of
transformation it does. Some of the most commonly used tasks are:
- `Converter`
- `Logger`
- `Reader`
- `Writer`

As mentioned previously, operation can also handle any processing of the data store itself. For example, fetching data
from a web endpoint or reading from a file. This means operations can potentially introduce side-effects.

Operation is denoted with the `:operation` keyword whose value is another map with the following keys:

| Key | Value | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `:type` | String | String | Indicates the type of the operation or an operation ID (prefixed with `id:`) |
| `:params` | String or keyword vector | String vector | Configuration applicable to the task itself. |

### Output
Once operation is performed, the output data is then sent to a data store or other tasks.

Triggers can also be attached to the output once transformation is completed.

Operation is denoted with the `:output` keyword whose value is another map with the following keys:

| Key | Value | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `:source` | String | String | Can either be a URL to a file, a web endpoint, a database or a task ID (prefixed with `id:`) |
| `:triggers` | String or keyword vector | String vector | Indicates what triggers to apply upon receiving input. Can either be built-in trigger or trigger ID (prefixed with `id:`) |

### Trigger

### Anatomy
A task at its simplest form is a Clojure map with the following keys:

| Key | Value | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `:type` | String | String | Indicates what type of task it is |
| `:input` | Depends on task type | Depends on task type | Indicates the input this task receives. |
| `:validators` | String or keyword vector | String vector | Indicates what validators to apply on the input |

### Conversion
This task reads data, does conversion, and then output the converted data. What type of conversion varies depending on
what type of input it receives and what possible conversion can be done to the input data.
